# ergRecord

A little Flask app to track some stats on your Concept 2 rower, especially heart rate if you have a heart rate sensor.

This project uses Py3Row, which is not on PyPI but can be found [here](https://github.com/droogmic/Py3Row).

I've only tested this on a Debian machine, and other Linux distros should be able to run this as long as you get Py3Row to work (I made an installation script for the module but will only work for machines with apt) but I don't think this can run on Windows or MacOS.
